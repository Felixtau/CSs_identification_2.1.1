my 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell highs satire is much closer to reality than is teachers.	0.
the scramble to survive financially the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers pomp the pettiness of the whole situation all remind me of the schools i knew and their students.	0.
when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school i immediately recalled ......... at .......... high.	0.
homelessness or houselessness as george carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter.	0.
most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on iraq pressuring kids to succeed technology the elections inflation or worrying if theyll be next to end up on the streets.but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what its like to be homeless?	0.
that is goddard bolts lesson.mel brooks who directs who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival jeffery tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries; if bolt succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings.	0.
the bets on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he cant step off the sidewalk.	0.
hes given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after its written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly lesley ann warren an ex dancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals sailor howard morris and fumes teddy wilson who are already used to the streets.	0.
hes not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where its fight or flight kill or be killed.while the love connection between molly and bolt wasnt necessary to plot i found life stinks to be one of mel brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles young frankenstein or spaceballs for the matter to show what its like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they dont know what to do with their money.	0.
maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money.or maybe this film will inspire you to help others.	0.
after being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently im a lawyer he says.	0.
jeffrey tambor a favorite from the later larry sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto.	0.
it does not give a realistic view of homelessness unlike say how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots.	0.
but still this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive.	0.
my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead i love mel as a director and writer not so much as a lead.	0.
there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so but all in all this is worth the price to rent and see it.	0.
the acting was good overall brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience.	0.
this isnt the comedic robin williams nor is it the quirky insane robin williams of recent thriller fame.	0.
this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over dramatization mixed with robins new love of the thriller.	0.
this is more a mystery suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper.also starring sandra oh and rory culkin this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report until williams character gets close to achieving his goal.i must say that i was highly entertained though this movie fails to teach guide inspect or amuse.	0.
it felt more like i was watching a guy williams as he was actually performing the actions from a third person perspective.	0.
in other words it felt real and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story.all in all its worth a watch though its definitely not friday saturday night fare.it rates a 7.7 10 from...the fiend .	0.
yes its an art... to successfully make a slow paced thriller.the story unfolds in nice volumes while you dont even notice it happening.fine performance by robin williams.	0.
the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film.	0.
use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good.very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story!	0.
in this critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events gabriel robin williams a celebrated writer and late night talk show host becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother toni collette.	0.
when troubling questions arise about this boys story however gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret?? according to films official synopsis.you really should stop reading these comments and watch the film now...the how did he lose his leg?	0.
ending with ms. collette planning her new life should be chopped off and sent to deleted scenes land.	0.
the true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious by the time mr. williams returns to new york.	0.
possibly her blindness could be in question   but a revelation could have be made certain in either the highway or video tape scenes.	0.
sandra oh as anna joe morton as ashe and rory culkin pete logand are all perfect.best of all collettes donna belongs in the creepy hall of fame.	0.
there have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women due to a slighter dispersion of roles; certainly they could have noticed collette with some award consideration.	0.
and director patrick stettner definitely evokes hitchcock   he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful.finally writers stettner armistead maupin and terry anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere.	0.
the night listener 2006 **1 2 robin williams toni collette bobby cannavale rory culkin joe morton sandra oh john cullum lisa emery becky ann baker.	0.
dir patrick stettner hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a stand out low key performance.what is it about celebrities and fans?	0.
in the latest derange fan scenario based on true events no less williams stars as a talk radio personality named gabriel no one who reads stories hes penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand culkin who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no ones editor ashe morton who gives it to no one to read for himself.	0.
no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna collette giving an excellent performance who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids.	0.
naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess cannavale whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and petes backgrounds discovering some truths that he didnt anticipate.written by armistead maupin who co wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the films novice director stettner and based on a true story about a fans hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot boiler does.	0.
it helps that williams gives a stand out low key performance as the conflicted good hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him the one thing that has escaped his own reality and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core.however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner it pays to listen to your own inner voice be careful of what you hope for.	0.
you know robin williams god bless him is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade with perhaps the exception of death to smoochy which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic.	0.
the night listener despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release is among his best work period.this is a very chilling story even though it doesnt include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter.	0.
the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed.	0.
in high school i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result.	0.
when i saw this movie the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker.	0.
it takes a good actress to play that sort of role and its this understated yet well reviewed role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award as of 2008. its incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this and its scary too.this is a good dark film that i highly recommend.	0.
when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves.	0.
that being said we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywood...writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded!	0.
with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel lifejess and the world around himdonna.as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably.	0.
the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward.its to bad that most people will avoid this film.	0.
robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people.	0.
like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art.oh and before i forget i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in.	0.
a very tense action scene that seemed well done.some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography unusual colors or interesting angles.	0.
constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of pyschosis have kept psychologists counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades.	0.
occasionally some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence.	0.
it tells the story of a popular radio host called gabriel noon robin williams who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about gay lifestyles.	0.
perhaps its because his show is losing its authentic veneer which causes noon to admit he is no longer himself.	0.
feeling abandoned by both his lover jess bobby cannavale and his and best friend joe morton he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation.	0.
noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called peter rory culkin.	0.
in reading the boys harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents noon is captivated and wants to help.	0.
however things are not what they seem and noon soon finds himself en wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare.	0.
this movie is pure robin williams and were it not for toni collette who plays donna d. logand sandra oh as anna and john cullum as pop this might be comical.	0.
i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie.the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well.do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads.	0.
if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed.my only complaint with the movie was the ending.	0.
the night listener is probably not one of williams best roles but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie.	0.
some people maybe wont like the slow pacing of this movie but i think its the great plus of the movie.	0.
it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year 2006. it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content dramatic feeling.	0.
you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be.	0.
like one of the previous commenters said this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery.	0.
i can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the reality of the story but i thought that part was reached when gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy.	0.
the night listener held my attention with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy rory culkin who is very ill. williams has never met the boy in person as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone.	0.
however williams ex boyfriend nice job from bobby cannavale raises doubt about the boy which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person.	0.
toni collette also stars.i enjoyed this film with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkins adoptive mother.	0.
the night listener is inspired by actual events and it has a somber almost creepy silence throughout.	0.
at times it is predictable no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic but i liked it anyway.	0.
i enjoy williams in roles like this more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me.	0.
popular radio storyteller gabriel no onerobin williamsscraggy and speaking in hushedhypnotic tones becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen year old boy from wisconsin named pete logandrory culkinwho has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents.	0.
to bootpete has aids and this compels gabriel further stillsince his partner jessbobby cannavalegoodhappens to be a survivor of hiv himself.	0.
he also acquaints himself with petes guardiana woman named donnatoni collettebrilliant!and when gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to wisconsinhe discovers some secrets he wasnaturallynot prepared to find.based on real events that happened to armistead maupinwho co wrote the screenplay with terry andersonand directed by patrick stetnerthis film moves a lot faster90 min.maybe a few minutes longerthan one might think a movie of this genre would run.	0.
its bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesnt sew up any of the plot openings or back story.	0.
id rather not go into any great detail except to say thatif you are not familiar with mr.maupins works or his personal storyyou feel a little bit out of the loop here.	0.
stillthe performances by williams i wouldve loved to heard more of his narrationpersonallycollettecannavaleculkin and much of the supporting castthe waitress at the restaurant colletes donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has!are top notch and the mood established here  namelythe chillylonely dark exteriors of wisconsin and new york  give a terrific framing for this story.	0.
it may have ends that dont tie together particularly wellbut its still a compelling enough story to stick with.	0.
the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about.	0.
however there is not much tension and williams mild mannered portrayal doesnt do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy.collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear.	0.
the book is probably better.one thing is certain taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort.	0.
even though there was nothing scary about the story itself i was soundly on edge through the whole movie   and for the rest of my evening.	0.
i found that there were so many perfect choices made...the casting the script the little bits of humor sprinkled in it.	0.
there were so many points where the film couldve gone for the cheap thrill but it never did and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately...and for the last number of years.	0.
it has weaknesses and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis no doubt but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this.	0.
the whole thing feels like one of those fireside this happened to a friend of a friend of mine ghost stories.	0.
one big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate.	0.
everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility and real life just sort of plods along??no?	0.
you have to get into the zone when watching this movie forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a conventionallygood movie.	0.
williams isnt terrific but he easily meets the needs of the story plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic no one as he is the everyman the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story.	0.
for quality and content alone the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days.	0.
when it comes to movies i can be pretty picky and ill complain about anything and everything that is done wrong.	0.
while every movie has its flaws the night listener had an exceptionally low count.if you read the last review it was hard since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done.	0.
unfortunately if you read more than 3 lines into that same review you discovered the posters reason for disdain he she does not like the fact that the director is gay or that the production team smokes crack...apparently.so despite the fact that i have never written a review before i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits not the sexual orientation of its director.	0.
i wont give a shred of it away but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials.	0.
the story really will amaze you even more so because its true and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events.2.	0.
robin williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type cast and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago.	0.
he once again achieves high form in his role in the night listener playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of...well ill let you see for yourself.3.	0.
of course i really dont think that makes a lick of difference the only thing that matters is if you like the direction but i thought i should simply establish once again that im basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant...for example not the sexual orientation of the director or the alleged drug habits of the production team lol.patrick stettners direction was moody and dark and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so sought after feelings of tension and release rather than the messy fast paced camera work and quick cuts were so often subjected to today.	0.
some people can truly show you a story through their camera while others feel as if they have to make the story with the camera.	0.
i really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized which is as an eyeball through which we all see.4.	0.
ive already wrote so much and i could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs so ill just wrap it up.in short go see this movie.	0.
dont listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it especially if theyre so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1 4 of the way through their post.	0.
somewhat funny and well paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless fast talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding u.s. treasury agent david morse to be released on the streets of new york to find a picky computer thief hacker doug hutchinson who stole forty two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead.bait marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua the replacement killers and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesnt top his first movie.	0.
what the two films have in common is the action sequences which are flat out excellent.foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning but throughout the film i began to catch on.	0.
hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient as the late laurence olivier was in marathon man.	0.
the legendary boris karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in mexico.	0.
karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as matthias morteval an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty greedy and backbiting no count relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will.	0.
pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life sized toy people who populate the place.	0.
onetime mexican sex symbol andres garcia of tintorera infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character.	0.
the clunky plodding nondirection trite by the numbers script ugly washed out cinematography ridiculous murder set pieces a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon!	0.
overwrought string score morbid gloom doom atmosphere largely lousy acting karloff notably excepted cheesy mild gore poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm.	0.
this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces the fall of the house of usher dance of death poem  is actually quite creepy from beginning to end.	0.
it is similar to some of the old black and white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house for example the cat and the canary the old dark house night of terror and so on.	0.
i wont go into too much detail here but it is definitely a must see for fans of old dark house mysteries.watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room.dan basinger 8 10	0.
also he declared that he had murdered another 16 people he used to kill pregnant women and then he set them on fire.this movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts.aro tolbukhin is a serious work so analytical its not morbid at all.	0.
after seeing several movies of villaronga i had a pretty clear opinion about him    he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters forgetting about a rhythm of the movie.	0.
in aro he follows the same line but really improved on the rhythm especially in the end of the movie.	0.
frankly speaking i slept through the first part cause though the first part gives necessary information it is really slow.	0.
nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by villaronga.recommended.	0.
en la mente del asesino inside the killers mind that its very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning.	0.
aro tolbukhin it??s like a movie made a documental or viceversa which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering did he really ever existed?	0.
the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala worked in a religious mission and then killed some people.	0.
the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death.	0.
the one we are witness of  the movie.for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aro??s mind mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done.	0.
nevertheless the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view; they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions we clearly never justify them.	0.
so the first half is based upon recollecting information; later things turn into aros childhood giving the movie such an incredible new force even tough never got weak or boring.i dont mean  and dont want  to spoil anything; so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you believe me the trip to see it is more than worthy.	0.
the casts is outstanding including tom bosley who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before ever.	0.
my one complaint i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy but other then that i think they did a great job.	0.
however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it.	0.
wagners dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing but his few scenes didnt detract from being entertained.	0.
mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster.	0.
she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be.	0.
sure titanic was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change.	0.
the second time and i am not the only one to think this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking when is this d**n ship going to sink???	0.
was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film i mean who does he think he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington?	0.
there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many love stories as it is filmmakers shouldnt try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie!!!	0.
you will love all the acting special effects and much much more.if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now!!!	0.
titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st century.with great actingdirectingeffectsmusic and generally everything.	0.
this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didnt like it any more so most of the world decided to agree.	0.
all i can say is that this movie not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies ive ever seen.	0.
the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton.	0.
as has been mentioned the low budget telemovie status of 13 gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal.	0.
having said that however the thing is not without merit   either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se.true the plot at its most basic is a re working of the amityville horror   only without much horror.	0.
gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax  investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the house as the main suspect.	0.
it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments.having picked the dvd up for a mere $3.95 last week at my regular video store i cannot begrudge the expenditure.	0.
it may not be the greatest movie of all time but gimme a break it got 11 oscars for a reason it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason.	0.
ive rewatched it on tv and video and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen twice or maybe three times actually.	0.
its a movie yes capital m there its an epic its a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur.	0.
now ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama.	0.
the melodrama was quite heavy handed at times.but the reason titanic works is that its such an emotional ride.	0.
but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million an emotional rollercoaster that if it were a regular one would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl.	0.
and im sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it and have a ready supply of cynicism then you can thoroughly dislike this movie.	0.
but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt youll enjoy it completely.	0.
spiderman was a fun movie but it was a total 9 11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did.	0.
i also wondered about why this great movie which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users.well i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings.	0.
these 10.7% of these irrational imdb users in effect pulled the overall rating down to 7.0. in my previous comments i blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in 1 ratings with a high 10 rating dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio.	0.
believe me ive tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men mostly who defame him left and right.	0.
to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesnt like the movie that much and gave it a 5 or a 6 etc.	0.
but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for titanic pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of titanic to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more but these 5 will prove my point.	0.
heavens gate 1980 was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing and imdb voters ratings were 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings overall rating of 6.1. big top pee wee 1988 got 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings overall rating of 4.5. cat people 1982 got 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings overall rating of 5.8. blind date 1987 got 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings overall rating of 5.3. jumpin jack flash 1986 got 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings overall rating of 5.2. what do all of these films have in common with titanic?	0.
compare that to the other 5 movies i just mentioned.can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor?	0.
its a movie to watch with your family by far.my mpaa rating pg 13 for thematic elements prolonged scenes of disastor nudity sexuality and some language.	0.
could will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it.	0.
yes im not the romance type either but that should not bother you because you will never see a romance like this.	0.
the plot is simple the acting is brilliant based on a true story probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten.	0.
well if you havent seen this film your missing out on something hesterical and a film to idolise for hollywood.	0.
i had few problems with this film and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated.	0.
the film looks sumptuous with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus.	0.
the story is very rich in detail and is hot on character development obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow.	0.
the last hour is extremely riveting and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat when the titanic sank.	0.
the music score by james horner was lovely though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on.	0.
the 1996 miniseries was good but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies.	0.
i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies.	0.
it was big fast and unsinkable... until april 1912. it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever.	0.
well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship.	0.
well onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film.so our two main characters are jack leonardo dicaprio and rose kate winslet.	0.
theyre not annoying too much but watch this and youll find out why they could become annoying  http  tinyurl.com ojhoyn .	0.
the main villain i guess is bad luck fate hand of god no blasphemy intended or just plain caledon hockley billy zane.	0.
the supporting characters are the following my personal favorite mr. andrews victor garberidk he was so nice lovejoydavid warner murdochewan stewart lightoller jonathan phillips captain smithbernard hill molly brownkathy bates and many more.	0.
a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond.	0.
titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill fated voyage on the unsinkable ship.	0.
writer director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april 15 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic.	0.
dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable.	0.
they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well.	0.
the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane kathy bates frances fisher jonathan hyde and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film.	0.
the love story the action suspense and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time.	0.
the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation.	0.
the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for its few flaws.	0.
titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it.	0.
the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg.	0.
overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.	0.
one of my favorite scenes is the dinner table scene in which roses family and friends meet jack after he saves her.	0.
rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet the one...i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband.jack and rose have a connection that is movie stuff but its good movie stuff.	0.
it has its problems what movies dont but still its enjoyable.when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic i suppose my first reaction is wait a minute you dont?	0.
all right the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic everyone knows that love like this doesnt actually exist.	0.
but this is a movie doesnt everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while?	0.
i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in.	0.
but the roles they are given are simple and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.and finally if one is going to complain that they dont like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic movies then im sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things.	0.
simply for being a movie not because you dislike the genre this is a good movie.well deserving of its oscars in particular best cinematography which i find to be the best ive ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy.i know some of the writing fails such as the constant screaming of each others names throughout the movie.	0.
the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times but overall its an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real and the sinking feel so epic.i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea such as it being a love story rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic including memoirs form the day it happened and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults.	0.
the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper not steel and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.i give this movie 10 10 not because i like romance movies but simply because its an outstanding cinematic achievement that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.	0.
maybe its just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays but when it was first made it was really something.	0.
some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd.	0.
many people died on that ship and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to.	0.
it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers.	0.
another aussie masterpiece this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural and it does very well.	0.
it doesnt resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks it focuses more on emotional impact.	0.
it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago.	0.
strange things begin to happen in the house and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared who was actually a mass murderer.	0.
through films such as aliens the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science fiction goes.	0.
the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows.	0.
the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful interesting and entertaining film about it.	0.
the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters arent given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is roses and jacks story alone no one else.	0.
it is composer james horners finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience.	0.
the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is.	0.
only one problem the usual james cameron problem is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside.	0.
james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime.	0.
back in 1997 do i remember that year clinton bans cloning research the unfortunate death of princess diana the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets.	0.
this was also the big year in the release of titanic one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster.	0.
i dont think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans 85% of them being teenage girls i was 12 years old at the time and of course saw the movie multiple times.	0.
it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful.	0.
at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong of course i grew up and didnt watch the film since i was 14 a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now.	0.
being completely honest here titanic is a great movie best movie of all time no just depends on your idea of a good movie but titanic delivered in romance humor disaster emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage.the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean.	0.
unsuccessful they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude wearing the heart of the ocean dated the day the titanic sank.	0.
101 year old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing.	0.
she and her granddaughter elizabeth lizzy calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship.	0.
when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater.	0.
in 1912 the upper class 17 year old rose boards the ship with her fianc?? cal hockley and her mother ruth dewitt bukater both of whom stress the importance of roses engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt bukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upper class rose and her mother are financially broke.	0.
distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern.	0.
jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first class formal dinner of the rapport building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance music and beer in third class.	0.
however after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven year old daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea rose defies him and her mother asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean an engagement present from cal.	0.
after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time they go to the deck of the ship.they then witness the ships fatal collision with an iceberg.	0.
after overhearing the ships lookouts discussing how serious the collision is rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal.	0.
meanwhile cal discovers roses nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jacks pocket.	0.
upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him.	0.
but after realizing that she cannot leave jack rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ships first class staircase.	0.
jack and rose return to the top deck the lifeboats have gone and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose down.so does titanic live up to its hype?	0.
i still say that this is a great movie to watch i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie.	0.
love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didnt get a lot of hype just because of leos baby face or kates amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special.	0.
it will always hold a special place in my heart it has too seeing that i saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released.	0.

captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned.	0.
smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty two years of experience to stretch the titanics legs out to full speed.	0.

overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic.many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.	0.
the core group of rose jack cal and roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.	0.
yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown; captain edward smith; the ship designer thomas andrew; the white star line representative bruce ismay; and all of the titanics officers were real.	0.

he had been a part of the white star line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaires captain when the titanic sunk.	0.
the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.	0.

all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware.	0.
the gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.	0.
the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re creation of the post victorian era of 1912. the rich at this time practically ruled everything as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.	0.
women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do.	0.
smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie.	0.
although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken.	0.
the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.	0.
everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night.	0.
in addition this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic.	0.
however the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.	0.
there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed.	0.
as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.technically the film is very well done.	0.
to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.	0.
in addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.	0.
cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.	0.
furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage.	0.
this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.	0.
at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic.	0.
like most history novels we know the ending but it doesnt take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture.	0.
certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing.	0.
if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for you.	0.
as for those that think that this film is overrated or over hyped...well we only have the movie going public to thank for that!	0.
lol* you see its not critics article writers that make a film huge or a hit with the general movie going public.	0.
at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking.	0.
this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april 1912. even the silverware for goodness sakes matched!	0.
when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth which is the best form of advertisement mind you that this was a good decent movie worth seeing then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once not twice but maybe 3 times and more!	0.
so i really wouldnt say that this movie was overhyped...at least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being overhyped.	0.
critics didnt even think that titanic would make enough money to cover camerons gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film.	0.
the dialogue could have been better but lets face it...the real star of the movie wasnt leo or kate...it was that gigantic ship!	0.
its not thier best work ive seen much better work from both of them but it wasnt the worst ive seen on screen before.	0.
long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an over hyped over blown overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz and i wanted nothing to do with it.	0.
one looked at me and said you might be right but if she liked the movie that much maybe shell want to learn more about the real titanic.	0.
the lead performances from kate winslet as rose and leonardo dicaprio as jack are excellent   winslets being the superior i thought but both were good.	0.
she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack.	0.
im no expert on the sinking of the titanic but i have a reasonable general knowledge and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance.	0.
who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dions performance of my heart goes on.problems.	0.
well the romance was perhaps too contrived in the sense that i just dont accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class.	0.
i know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until hes been there for a while.	0.
the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed i thought when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.	0.
my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre where i think it would have been so much more impressive.9 10	0.
to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue the budget the this and the that....who wants to hear it?	0.
i am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life and this one stands in its own entity in my book.	0.
it made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet and is the top grossing film in the planet.	0.
i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago these same people were moved to tears by that very movie.	0.
and theyre too embarrassed now to admit it.i just rewatched titanic for the first time in a long time.	0.
expecting to simply enjoy the story again i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years.	0.
it brought me back to 1997 when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time.	0.
a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall yes even more than star wars.	0.
some of the dialogue falls flat and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly.	0.
however none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful.	0.
the movie really was hers and she held it together beautifully.james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable titanic.	0.
and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.the music which has also been a victim of the films success was a key ingredient.	0.
too bad celine dions pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.i confess i am a titanic buff.	0.
perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because ive had such an interest in the ship all my life.	0.
the film was made with such humanity.another reviewer said it better than i ever could open up your hearts to titanic and you will not be disappointed.	0.
but i was able to identify with every characters heartaches and pains.this is a movie teenagers should watch.	0.
im sorry for those that dont understand the value of love family and friendship.it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing.	0.
and it is great to see a 19 year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance.	0.
note hollywoodland... his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in 2006.this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages.	0.
maybe shouldnt be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families but i recommend it to the entire family.i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times.	0.
after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century australian street we meet julie rebecca gibney and peter john adam as they go out house hunting.	0.
they manage to get a loan for a fixer upper on a posh sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home.	0.
it just may be haunted.13 gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clich??d story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shocker.the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle.	0.
there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity.	0.
as it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at that.after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves.	0.
the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror 1979 though the budget forces a much subtler approach.	0.
millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effects oriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall.for some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama.	0.
at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in.	0.
the material is done well enough that its often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later  especially if youve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house.once they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good.	0.
there isnt an abundance of death and destruction in the film  theres more of an abundance of home repair nightmares.	0.
the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it.	0.
that its in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe such as money or health problems.	0.
peters character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal work based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful.	0.
julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship.although 13 gantry row never quite transcends its made for television clunkiness as a tv movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions.	0.
anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horror thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy.	0.
it certainly isnt worth spending $30 for a dvd that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling but its worth a rental and its definitely worth watching for free.	0.
this movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children.	0.
in these times of heather has two mommies or what ever you fill in the blanks it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone.	0.
what i find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment be it television or.	0.
love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about.	0.
the kids grow upone all be it in the hard way to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall.	0.
yes i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent.	0.
this true to life is one which every young adult and parent would do well to see although some will not realize it until they too are parents.	0.
the father stays with and nurtures the kids letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them.	0.
i must admit when i read the description of the genre on netflix as steamy romance i was a little bit skeptical.	0.
and when i realized it was shot entirely in black & white i knew my erotic hopes were dashed.boy was i wrong!	0.
not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance    the discovery of first love fear of the secret being found out a sudden unexpected end    but at times this movie was downright erotic.	0.
its 1968. do you really expect teenagers from the 60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this?	0.
anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much.i think this movie was way ahead of its time.	0.
the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown.i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here.	0.
as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action although it wont be all you expect i dont think youll be too too disappointed.	0.
watching this film made me remember my first love.thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life love and the meaning of loss.highly recommended for all film lovers.	0.
it was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact?? even by todays standards the film is interesting and provocative?? therese and isabelle are both attending the same girls school?? therese is energetic intelligent and becomes a mentor for the innocent naive sweet isabelle?? she guides her through a number of exotic experiences including a trip through an exclusive brothel into her first lesbian liaison and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience?? the film does not exploit any sex nor is there an abundance of nudity... the imagery is effective but sometimes the camera lingers too long and the story goes slowly?? the director radley metzger went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of henry paris?? he always has extremely detailed stories good acting and very high standards of cinematography...artistically however this is perhaps his most complete?? his later attempts supplied for entertainment whereas therese and isabelle was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism...	0.
we watched this in my womens health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies and i absolutely loved this movie.	0.
the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women but this movie was more than that.	0.
i was going to bed with my gf last night and while she was brushing her teeth i flipped channels until i came across this chinese movie called the king of masks.	0.
at first i thought it was going to be a kung fu movie so i started watching it and then it immediately captured me in and i had to finish it.the little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble.	0.
maybe the fact it was in chinese so the english was dubbed made it harder for me to tell...but she really seemed to be in character perfectly.	0.
i felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her boss but everything just turned out rotten.	0.
even when she brings him another grandson just so he can pass on his art...it turns out that kid was kidnapped so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live.	0.
lol...whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa just backfires.in the end he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks...which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie.definitely a gem and totally original.scott	0.
i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his her reluctant guardian.	0.
ive seen enough of them ?? baby boom kolya about a boy mostly martha and to some extent whale rider ?? to expect to be bored by the formula.	0.
what held my attention in the king of masks was the grimness of the setting small town china in the 1930s.	0.
extreme poverty was the norm and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market.	0.
when wang discovers his purchased grandson whom hes nicknamed doggie is a granddaughter he initially casts her out even though shes showed great promise as street performing heir.	0.
the film is gritty then showing the lengths to which a young street smart girl had to go to survive in that society.the two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context.	0.
in a western society one would expect at least a hint of resentment from wang at not having achieved more material success.	0.
wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status though that i did too.	0.
while doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern suburban child its completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage.	0.
and after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her her fierce attachment to wang makes perfect sense.the peek at small town life in a foreign country the naturalness of the two lead actors the surprising plot twists and of course the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film.	0.
a story of friendship courage kindliness and loyalty between a street performing who famous to the king of masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar.	0.
by his own admission he read 2 chapters of the book got bored and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch.heinlein would have never supported that trash if hed been alive to see it.	0.
it basically steals the name mocks politics of the book which is a good portion of it and throws in some t&a so the average idiot american moviegoer doesnt get bored.this anime isnt perfect but its at least mostly accurate as best i can tell.	0.
wang bianlian is an old street performer who is known as a king of masks for his mastery of sichuan change art.	0.
liang is worried that a precious art shouldnt die with wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to wangs mind.	0.
the film is about prejudices male domination state of art values and most importantly warmth.i cant recommend this film enough.	0.
for five minutes it is an artistic film next five minutes its a sad film next five minutes its a thriller.	0.
stellar performances by her doggie the old man the king of masks and liang the living boddhisatva.spoiler the deplorable treatment of children especially females is disturbing.loved the music.	0.
the original chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story.this is a must see    enjoyable family film although not for very young children.	0.
would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version.	0.
the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by minglun weii hope he has more stories in him.the acting is sublime.	0.
renying zhou as doggie was amazing    very natural talent and xu zhu was a delight   very believable as the jaded old traditionalist.	0.
if only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong kong  a family friendly well acted well written well directed near perfect gem.	0.
i liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the 1930s chinese mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions   i felt i could get a real sense of the times recreated even in splendid shots of traditional chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living.	0.
the interwoven role which buddhism plays is probably the most true to form   both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect perhaps the most effective that ive seen in chinese film.	0.
the king of masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship.	0.
set in 1930s china during a time of floods we meet wang an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him.	0.
taking the advice to heart wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy; he would teach his new son doggie the ancient art of silk masks.	0.
soon wang discovers a fact about doggie that threatens the rare and dying art.together wang and doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it.	0.
this is a superb movie suitable for all but the very youngest though accessibility for younger people was marred at least in the print which i saw by the use of some unfortunate choice of english sub titling!	0.
for much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time period it is set   there is no modern technology shown not even the ubiquitous chinese bicycle just a drab almost monochrome everyday life against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the sezuan opera and of celebratory fireworks.	0.
even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war this could still be any time in the past 150 years.but then we briefly see a motor car   late 30s early 40s style   and we realise that we are watching a china on the verge of huge upheavals and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of world war 2 and the communist revolution.which makes the central characters desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant.but the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today both within china and in other parts of the world the inequality between boys and girls men and women; the trade for various purposes in young children; corruption in society; injustice; the importance of friendship.maybe im reading too much into this film; but i dont think so!	0.
i also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the united kingdom whilst dross is passed off as quality material.but dont get me started on that...	0.
winner of 16 awards from around the world this film based on a true story centers on wang bianlian a street performer in 1930s china who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face change opera.	0.
he has a longing desire to have a grandson as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir.	0.
we then go to the streets and see that people are selling their children because they cant afford to take care of them some are even begging to take their daughters for free because daughters are not worth much in this society.	0.
wang bianlians story goes on from there.the film was so astonishingly good the acting was amazing and the issues were so weighty and well addressed.	0.
there is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place no one wants a little girl.	0.
also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the living bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman and while he is famous and well respected he regards himself as something low a half woman.	0.
as we go further into the film the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it the brutality and corruption of the military and police and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions.this is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life and xu zhu the actor who plays wang bianlian presents yet another beautiful performance.	0.
this is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting; characters about whom you come to care deeply; writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense.	0.
you have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions.	0.
this movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets.	0.
you see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture.	0.
this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation.	0.
women and performers both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china.	0.
this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture.the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors performance.a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies.	0.
robert a. heinleins classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years in everything to paul verhoevens 1997 film to a tv series to a number of games.	0.
the games are usually unrelated the tv series was more of a spin off and the less said about verhoevens film the better.	0.
little do most know however that in japan an animated adaptation had already been done released the year of heinleins death.	0.
and believe it or not despite its differences this 6 part animated series is plot wise the most faithful adaptation of heinleins classic.the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons something we were deprived of in verhoevens film.	0.
like the book the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel though we see a fair amount of each.	0.
rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement but its only slightly more touched upon than in the book.	0.
while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book it gets a bit of the anime treatment but what did you expect?	0.
the big payoff of the series however is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugs aliens which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.overall i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein.	0.
as i was watching this film on video last night i kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure.	0.
ive a feeling ill be watching this again and again for years to come.its got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story film.	0.
and even though some cultural references are obscure for me a western viewer at the core this is a universal tale.	0.
when tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir the aging and very proud street performer known to all as the king of masks becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate.his warmth and humanity tho find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by chinas devastating natural disasters in this case massive flooding in the 1930s.he takes his new 7 year old companion onto his straw houseboat to live with his prized and beautiful monkey general only to discover that the he child is a she child.his life is instantly transformed as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man.there are many stories inside this one...many people are touched and the culture of china opens itself for our western eye to observe.	0.
thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama and few will leave this dvd behind with a dry eye.the technical transfer itself is not that great as i found the sound levels all over the meter and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie.	0.
an unexpected pleasure as i had heard nothing about this film.shameful since it warrants having a wider audience.a wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told although admittedly predictable in its resolution.	0.
beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film.my recent foray into chinese film shower the road home not one less has been an exciting one that i hope to continue exploring.	0.
the king of masks can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent chinese film.	0.
one of the great things about many of the superb chinese movies you can find if you are lucky in the video stores is they are very accurate retellings of actual true stories.	0.
the film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience    the hallmark of much hollywood and especially disney films.in this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the king of masks for his mastery of sichuan change art.	0.
along an having lost his only son many years earlier he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work.	0.
from there the story get very interesting with a good performance by master liang of the sichuan opera    a regional operatic style related to peking opera.	0.
fans of farewell my concubine should look carefully at master liangs portrayal of a male playing the female role in chinese opera.	0.
it may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality.	0.
quote by nicolas martin nicmart from houston tx fine film but dvd reformatted for tv 8 april 2002   this is a charming and emotive film.	0.
on the other hand the dvd i purchased has been reformatted to fit your tv by the clods at columbia tristar.	0.
there is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format except that hollywood treats all films like the moronic disposable trash that it is so used to producing.	0.
see here for details http  www.dvdbeaver.com film dvdcompare2 kingofmasks.htmwonderful performances by the two main actors the king and doggie btw.	0.
at its simplest it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art masks to the next generation.	0.
although at times the story makes the old man into a job it is so well crafted written acted directed wonderful production values it is easy to move beyond his plight.	0.
it will break your heart not because its over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through.	0.
you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time.	0.
despite the times and the influences the man is kind and good.overall the performances are first rate especially xu zhu who portrays the street performer.	0.
the two protagonists along with supporting help from the kind opera singer master liang an interestingly androgynous zhao zhigang paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness sadness and love.	0.
some have mentioned this films remote similarities to ba wang bie ji farewell my concubine; yet this film cant stand easily on its own any resemblance is remote at best.my only qualm with the king of masks is the ending.	0.
the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well.	0.
the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine which was more sophisticated and intricate.	0.
the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism humanity and history portrayed.	0.
im really not into sci fi but for some reason i love stargate sg 1. jack oneil takes his team sg 1 through a stargate.	0.
it gives you things happenings and such you can relate to and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets.	0.
in the rapid economic development of 1990s in china there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth and more importantly due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural revolutionary era.however the resurgence of chinese traditional culture namely the confucianism was not without disasters because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example.moreover not only the part that should be discarded were inherited the good part that was supposed to be inherited such as the traditional opera and its technique such as changing face was ignored in the resurgence and facing extinction.the director used this film to criticize the problem of re embracing tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie.	0.
basically it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a male heir to carry on his craft but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male dominated world.	0.
the characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and societys traditional notions.the story is fun emotional and complex.	0.
the exploration of the characters their lives and emotions is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all.	0.
the film expertly conveys the old mans emotions and his desire to find an heir and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation.	0.
the film also examines the good and bad of traditional chinese culture creating further interest and depth to the film.the directing acting and scenery are all outstanding.	0.
added to the other strengths this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling real characters.	0.
as a result the film evokes strong empathy for and feelings about the characters.some have claimed that the ending weakens the film but i do not necessarily agree.	0.
perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small.	0.
the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub titles.	0.
the fact that this film was put out on dvd still formatted to tv and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists......and rightly so.	0.
this deserves a lot better treatment.the story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft the rules of the day and winds up with a little girl instead not the conventional way ....and the problems that ensue afterward.	0.
the old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy which he obviously thought was the case.the old man bianlian wang xu zhuis kind of funny looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin.	0.
i usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final 15 minutes.overall its involving story complete with drama suspense humor and sadness.	0.
it shows a china i had never seen or imagined and i believe it shows 1930s china in the most real light ever seen in a movie.	0.
it is absolutely heart breaking in so many situations seeing how hard life was for the characters and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful.	0.
i just saw this movie today with my children son 10 and daughter 4.5 at the 3rd annual roger ebert overlooked film festival.	0.
after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director tian ming wu.	0.
he through a translator told several stories about his life and the making of the film.all tangents aside both of my children really enjoyed this movie.	0.
of course i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter but much of the film is visually self explanatory.i wont give anything away but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than 95% of the hollywood crap especially childrens films out there.cheers.p.s.	0.
the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to 4 masks at a time then they would cut and change to 4 new masks.	0.
this is a lot of silliness about a woman from london who marries a tea planter from ceylon whom she barely knows.	0.
fabulous costumes by edith head who painted them on liz taylor at her finest!the sfx are very good for a movie of its age and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors even down to body type a rarity in movies of this vintage.a cozy movie with splendid panoramas    even when chopped down to pan and scan.	0.
elephant walk 1954 starring an early peter finch as lord of the manor in some god forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad englishmen staying out in the midday sun and going berserk.	0.
or type on a computer keyboard theyd probably give this eponymous film a rating of 10. after all no elephants are shown being killed during the movie; it is not even implied that any are hurt.	0.
to the contrary the master of elephant walk john wiley peter finch complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms  no matter how menacing  without a permit from the government and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability.	0.
furthermore the elements conspire  in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic  to leave the wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people as the natives dub them to close the story.	0.
if you happen to see the current release earth youll detect the elephant people are faring less well today.	0.
i got in to this excellent program in about season 4 and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10. it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after 10 seasons.	0.
sadly now the sci fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a 11 season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more.	0.
this tv show is a must see for all sci fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it !!!!!	0.
i was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue but was pleased to find a fast paced script an underlying moral excellent portrayals from all the actors especially peter finch amazing special effects suspense and beautiful cinematography  theres even a shot of the majestic stone buddhas recently destroyed by the taliban.	0.
not to mention elizabeth taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work.	0.
all the supporting players round it out and i do wonder who trained all those elephants.speaking of the stone buddha sequence you really can discern that its vivien leigh in the long shots.	0.
the only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk.if you want a thought provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring spend a few hours with elephant walk.	0.
i watched elephant walk for the first time in about 30 years and was struck by how similar the story line is to the greatly superior rebecca.	0.
as others have said you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the manor only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a larger than life yet deeply flawed relative.	0.
you have the stern and disapproving servant a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homestead.meanwhile elephant walk also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to the letter the bette davis love triangle set on a singapore rubber plantation rather than a sri lankan tea plantation.maltin gives elephant walk just two stars and imdb readers arent much kinder but i enjoyed it despite its predictability.	0.
elizabeth taylor never looked lovelier and peter finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father.	0.
dana andrews    a favorite in laura and the best year of our lives    is wasted as elizabeths frustrated admirer.	0.
the scintillating elizabeth taylor stars in this lesser known classic as a young girl from london who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from british ceylon current day sri lanka.	0.
upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd.	0.
william dieterle who also directed the life of emile zola and portrait of jennie  does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark and almost eerie undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful ive seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery.	0.
a beautiful shopgirl in london is swept off her feet by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and living with him at his villa in british ceylon.	0.
although based upon the book by robert standish this initial set up is highly reminiscent of hitchocks rebecca with leading lady elizabeth taylor clashing with the imposing chief of staff at the mansion and almost immediately her own husband who is still under the thumb of his deceased but dominant father.	0.
taylor a last minute substitute for an ailing vivien leigh looks creamy smooth in her high fashion wardrobe and her performance is quite strong; however once husband peter finch starts drinking heavily and barking orders at her one might think her dedication to him rather masochistic this feeling hampers the ending as well.	0.
still the film offers a heady lot for soap buffs romantic drama a bit of travelogue interpretive dance an elephant stampede and a perfectly timed outbreak of cholera!	0.
elephant walk may not be the acme of literature or of film but it is great entertainment in the quasi melodramatic mode.	0.
it is the story of love both genuine and illicit as well as overweening ambition devotion and the arrogance of personal tyranny.	0.
a previous reviewer john mankin questions why the central focus of the film the mansion called elephant walk should have been built by the former owner the governor the late tom wiley right across the elephants traditional path to the major source of water the river.	0.
to miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film the hubris of man.	0.
that his son played by peter finch should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father is not unexpected since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his fathers rowdy boys club as his role models.	0.
the point of the father was that he was a self made man who would tame nature to his liking and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd and thus he would dominate his son and all around him and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water.	0.
who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water?	0.
this is the nexus of the film what will animals do to get water; what will humans do to get power or love?	0.
ceylon todays sri lanka is the huge island off the coast of india where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story not just the expenses of miss taylor.	0.
were it not for this exotic location much of the film was shot in ceylon and the magnificent bungalow this would have been just another potboiler.	0.
one must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the english immigrant conquerors that were part and parcel of the british raj.	0.
it is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony teak and marble.	0.
not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved jalees grille work window and doorway borders evidently specified by art directors j. mcmillan johnson and hal pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island.	0.
such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought.for those immune to the blandishments of time place and architecture there is always the allure of miss taylor as she marries a man she doesnt really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man against the background described and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased.	0.
as i said it is not great literature nor even great film but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today.this is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drive in not on the home tv so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera work and scope.	0.
she was twenty two when she made elephant walk remember im nine so the feelings arent sexual i just couldnt see anything else on the screen.	0.
she has begun to show her age shes almost seventy four but i still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have lived.i have seen the movie several times since and it is a sappy melodrama.	0.
what saves it is of course miss taylors beauty magnificent scenery the very impressive elephant stampede and a well made point on human arrogance in the face of nature.all in all a well spent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video.	0.
robert standishs novel is about a triangular romantic situation on a ceylonese tea plantation... so the events of the ceylon backgrounds and pictorial beauty are rewarding points to william dieterles film...the story is about a rich powerful planter peter finch who brings a charming and tender beauty elizabeth taylor into the jungle as his bride... the plantation of course is endangered by some kind of wild life... for this reason taylor ?? elegant as never in dazzling costumes ?? finds herself in a strange atmosphere... the echo determination of a ghost the bad temper of a husband obsessed by the memory of his autocratic father a highly dangerous disease and the fury of wild animals...in her confusion boredom and annoyance elizabeth taylor looks to a friendly face a pretentious foreman dana andrews who admires her beauty but tries to conquer her love...with echoes of jane eyre the mysterious yorkshire mansion with a brooding master and rebecca the innocent young second wife hunted by the image of the glamorous first wife elephant walk is a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge tropical bungalow exotic dances with rage excessively colorful stampeding big bull elephants amazing mansion set on fire all in the company of an exquisite creature with an unquestioned beauty and talent...the movie gave liz a change of scenery and allowed her more creative energy and self respect than most of her other willful debutante rebels?? the wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will and so taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit for	0.
one of the first ovas original video animation i ever bought this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles.	0.
a cyberpunk sci fi action comedy set against an unlikely for a comedy that is background of near future pollution in a dystopian society.the heroes of dominion are the tank police formed with a if we cant beat crime well get bigger guns philosophy and who are like the name suggests patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch.	0.
psychopaths and neurotics giving new meaning to the phrase loose cannons.equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries terrorist buaku and his henchwomen the twin cat sisters whose existence always seems to involve giving the tank police a hard time.the animation is not state of the art but its very nice otherwise; the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of dominion.the english dubbing is again lots of fun.	0.
its japanese cyberpunk sf with lots of comedy filled with completely over the top characters and situations making sure that it never takes itself seriously.	0.
dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt one of the most amazing shows ever produced but not just in the field of animation.	0.
while the first part acts 1 and 2 mostly consists of action and fun the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part.	0.
you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part acts 3 and 4. i do have some complaints though.	0.
in the first part the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all.	0.
one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool.	0.
seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists the government of the fictional new port city form the tank police to deal with the problem   cops with tanks!	0.
oh the insanity!the heroes of this series include the new recruit leona ozaki a red haired japanese woman yeah i know they never match their distinctly japanese names with a japanese appearance who has just been drafted into the tank police and is quickly partnered with blond blue eyed nice guy al.	0.
leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of tank police commander charles britain also known as brenten a big guy who looks like tom selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses a big revolver and a bad temper.	0.
britain didnt like having leona join the tank police in the first place and her wrecking his tiger special a giant green monster tank doesnt exactly endear her to him nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini tank that she nicknames bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare where the boys are more your size as he puts it.	0.
theres also specs the bifocal genius bible quoting god fearing chaplain purple mo hawked mohican and the pot bellied chief whos right on the edge thanks to the mayor always yelling at him about the tank police antics.	0.
seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them theyre not very well liked by the people.the villains are a cyborg named buaku whos got a mysterious past thats connected with a project known as green peace his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks anna & uni puma.	0.
in the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who havent been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the 2nd theyre hired to steal a painting that is of a naked buaku.	0.
the story however was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic manga book thats very hard to find.all sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred.	0.
this is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it youd better go get quentin tarantino.	0.
how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg 1 remains a cheesy sci fi tv series.stargate sg 1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly.	0.
special fx arent nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isnt going to blow you out of the chair.	0.
or couch for that matter either.but and this is where i really think stargate sg 1 deserves all the credit it can get for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci fi movie thats actually worse than a one hour tv episode.in fact some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still have been better than most movies.and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg 1 special.i am very picky with my selections.	0.
i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught.so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg 1 as yet another tacky sci fi show dont.	0.
it is a full frontal assault of psychedelic pulsating epilepsy inducing flashing lights and colours and the first true merging of film and video in avante garde cinema.	0.
theres no story to speak of but bartlett uses images of nature ?? particularly the human face and form ?? to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions integrating these biological phenomena into the highly industrial form of modern technology.	0.
this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal9000 in stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey 1968 and indeed bartletts opening sequence of images ?? flashing colours before a close up human eye ?? recalls dave bowmans journey through the stargate.	0.
the visuals are richly coloured a confronting blend of sharp vivid photography and increasingly grainy video as though were sitting too close to a television screen {as a matter of fact the end product was recorded from a tv monitor}.there appears to be some confusion about the films release date.	0.
imdb lists the film as a 1972 release but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give 1968 as the correct year.	0.
perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the films completion and its first public screening.	0.
either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video and some brisk techno music wouldnt have gone amiss either!	0.
offon captures grainy fragmented images presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information.	0.
i had a thought ?? and please dont laugh at this free thinking interpretation ?? that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earths television signals might very well receive such a disjointed alien documentation of human life a bizarre montage of only vaguely familiar imagery that couldnt possibly make any coherent sense.	0.
perhaps this is where mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an irreversible merging of film and video of purity and artificiality.	0.
they were even better than i had experienced at first.my only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime warranting tanks and heavy artillery it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals.	0.
if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda it certainly has not been shown as such.i dont think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this.	0.
but regarding the story there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused.	0.
the storyline across the 4 parts blends mindless action slap stick humor touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions.	0.
i have to start saying it has been a long time since i have seen it but have seen it 5 or more times; a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence.	0.
kay kysers mysteries would be a good example.having spike jones unleashed is the best part of the show as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action doing a fine job of support.	0.
hugh obrien plays the face buddy hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to lou costello and thus abbott and costello replacing the leads.	0.
dont know if that was true.all in all a pleasant movie but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history.	0.
the movie is funny and spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business.	0.
i like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages.the movie is about a turn of the century firehouse with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band when not fighting the fires.	0.
the performance by om puri smita patil and sadashiv amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by govind nihlani.	0.
sadhashiv as rama shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain.	0.
and to add to this all kafi inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings.	0.
he is also the guru of om puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble.the movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody.	0.
om puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in ardh satya.	0.
may be the first one which portrayed the stark reality of corruption in the police force & politics with no holds barred & how it effects on a young cop.	0.
todays generation which grown up watching dark & realistic films like  satya company may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making.	0.
the film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people didnt pay much attention to such kind of cinema & yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class & mass audience when it released.	0.
for om puri its first breakthrough in mainstream hindi cinema & he delivered a class performance as inspector velankar.	0.
shafi inamdar was truly a discovery for me & hes a brilliant character actor if given a chance & here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even om.	0.
the movie is also a debut of a promising villain on indian screen  sadashiv amrapurkar as rama shetty.	0.
its another story that he didnt get such a meaty role & almost forgotten today as one of the loud villain of dharmendras b grade action films.	0.
watch the scene where om 1st time becomes a rebel for his father played by amrish puri & next both are sharing wine together.	0.
how inner truth started revealing for both the character with confronting feelings of love & hate for each other.	0.
two faces of indian police force  masculinity & impotency and in between lies  half truth ardh satya??kudos to nihalanis touch.	0.
the film won 2 national awards as best hindi feature film & best actor  om puri & 3 filmfare awards in best film best director & best supporting actor categories.	0.
after aakrosh  this was the second film for govind nihalani as a director.till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in india.this movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence.	0.
this movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood likecoolie betaabhero in 1983.smithapatel in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him.	0.
she was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs.at one timeshe even gave up her love when the heros ruthlessness touched the roof top.there was another character in this movie which was played by om puri contemporary naseeruddin shah.he played as an inspector turned alcoholic character.the role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the heros ending.in his debut filmsadashiv amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare.the cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent.	0.
directed by the great director govind nihalani this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success.	0.
even today ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india.the film tells the real life scenario of mumbai police of the 70s.	0.
govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment.amongst various police officers & colleagues the film describes the story of anand velankar a young hot blooded cop coming from a poor family.	0.
anand himself suffers from his fathers ideologies & incidences of his fathers atrocities on his mother.	0.
anands approach towards immediate action against crime is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction.	0.
the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anands constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.this leads to frustrations as he cannot achieve the desired job satisfaction.	0.
resulting from the frustrations his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars also turning him to an alcoholic.the spirit within him is still alive as he constantly fights the system.	0.
he is aware of the system of the metro where the police & politicians are a inertly associated by far end.	0.
one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shettys house to arrest him followed by short conversation which is fantastic.	0.
alcoholism corruption political influence courage deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today.	0.
those aspects are dealt brilliantly.finally the films belongs to the one man show om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.	0.
this movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society.this is the story of a cop om puri  who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer.	0.
the first attempt in bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about mumbai cops.	0.
after this movie a slew of bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal politician police nexus.	0.
om puri plays an inspector velankar who is forced to protect underworld don rama shetty played brilliantly by sadahiv amrapurkar.	0.
this was sadashiv amrapurkars acting debut.om puri won a national award for this film for the best actor.	0.
i love this show!every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is.	0.
its amazing season after season the show gets better and better.ive been a fan of macgyver since i was 5 19 now and i find it so ironic that my 2 favorite tv shows of all time star richard dean anderson.	0.
its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other.back when i first saw stargate the movie i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci fi flicks then hearing a tv show would spin from it i got really excited but didnt get showtime till the fifth season was almost over.though im disappointed to hear that roland emmerich and dean devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio optioned the series instead.	0.
characters plotting their own play promises triumph and a militant character readily lends oneself to this.	0.
the line goes   ek palde mein napunsaktha doosre palde mein paurush aur teek tarazu ke kaante par ardh satya ?.	0.
a rough translation   the delicate balance of right & wrong  commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts  has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another.	0.
it makes a deep impact on the protagonist & lays the foundation for much of the later events that follow.	0.
at the end of the film om puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem.the film tries mighty hard to do a one up on the poem.	0.
aesthetically its lackluster and cheap looking the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in cohesive but this adds to its charm.	0.
i say this because its a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and as such theres really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits.	0.
there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary.	0.
overall its worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general but dont expect brilliance here.	0.
i was under impressed by it and my feelings havent much changed.documentary about the infamous edward d. wood jr. covering his life and movies.	0.
more than a few of those interviewed especially lugosi jr. pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear.	0.
not being a swooning ed wood jr. fan i prefer to appreciate his boundless enthusiasm and acknowledge his shortcomings.	0.
i hoped and was delighted to find that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise.	0.
from beginning to end this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr.what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives positive and negative and showing us their character as much as eds.	0.
we get insight into eds personal and professional life from his romances to his drinking to his sexuality to his friends to his enemies and even to his film making.the film itself is shot in a low budget way that seems done out of respect for ed as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the president.	0.
the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background.fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding ed wood controversies and new comers will be amazed that this man was real.	0.
the dvd is full of impossible to find gems crossroads of lorado and photo galleries but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story.ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him for better or worse to the point where one woman will go down in history as swimming pool owner for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool.	0.
this ability to define a persons legacy comes through universally as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr. but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created.	0.
somehow without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement.even the title hints at the b list horror genre but by the end we see that even this is a kindness.	0.
what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with woods legend.in many ways a living contradiction ed wood jr. could not be condensed to a single viewpoint.	0.
being itself a juxtaposition of themes it is at once respectful provocative thoughtful gripping fun sad kind and fulfilling.	0.
the haunted world of edward d. wood jr. is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as glen or glenda bride of the monster and of course plan 9 from outer space.	0.
this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries such as look back in angora and the plan 9 companion failed.	0.
it rounds up his surviving entourage many of whom have passed away since filming and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work.	0.
nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood sentimental in its treatment of the director down to the haunting music this documentary is an absolute must see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day.	0.
the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together eds life and untimely death for the viewer.	0.
this film deals with the atrocity in derry 30 years ago which is commonly known as bloody sunday.the film is well researched acted and directed.	0.
the disgraceful white wash that was the widgery tribunal is also dealt with.overall this is an excellent drama which is moving and shocking.	0.
an excellent and accurate film... mcgovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off.	0.
he is not afraid to tell the truth even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossy.once again mcgovern brings in christopher eccleston though not in as high a profile a role as he played in hillsborough.	0.
i found this movie as accurate well acted and well presented as hillsborough and i applaud mcgovern for his poignant unapologetic writing.	0.
the story of a drifter his sheep ranch boss and the bosss daughter is not for all tastes but its still very intriguing.	0.
it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand amongst the scenery weve come to know so well through other films from this region.this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary regan and ive been a fan of hers ever since.	0.
the cast also contains bruno lawrence who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film smash palace.	0.
terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter regan.	0.
i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america but believe you me the unexpurgated version is not to be missed.	0.
i really like miikes movies about yakuza this one i saw about 2 years ago and it really fu**ed my head.	0.
i havent seen the uk or japan version but i have to say that i believe that the german dvd is a bit censored.	0.
if you havent seen the movie already and live in germany maybe you better look out for a dvd from the nederlands or austria.	0.
the i on dvd contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes but at the showdown i felt that something was missing about one or two very short scenes.all in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence thats what i like miike for!	0.
anyone new to the incredibly prolific takashi miikes work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director.	0.
in keeping with miikes working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with.	0.
what takes the movie out of the realms of the same old same old however is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in todays cinema.	0.
and this isnt that nice cool clean violence so beloved of us cinema   this stuff is nasty painful and hurts!	0.
that said the pace is breakneck the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities miikes sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be making it hard to look away from the screen whatever he might be showing you!	0.
it doesnt have the ohmigod ending of dead or alive but if youre not squeamish nows the time to get on board the miike bandwagon before he ends up on some hollywood studios new john woo shopping list...	0.
i love jacks jokes like the clich?? is... or over the top clich?? guy black oily skin kinda spooky.... he is just hilarious!	0.
!i just love all the plots season 8 a little less i have to admit the characters are great the actors are great im starting to pick up facial expressions and more from jack daniel and tealc...it just all theoretically possible and exciting...oops!	0.
sorry im also starting to pick up traits from carter and all of this is driving my parents nutz!!!!!!!	0.
well to conclude i think its good for another three seasons or so especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor drama action and so forth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0.
the movie starts something like a less hyper kinetic more pastiche dead or alive strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers.	0.
but when a police officer is killed one tatsuhito gets involved... and when he discovers that his brother shihito is also involved things get bloody quite fast.an earlier work of miikes shinjuku triad society is still filled with his usual in the ol ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts though its not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces.	0.
rather its a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction as tatsuhito digs his way through the underground a maze that leads him to a gay triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from taiwan and keeps an almost brothel of young boys one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning.	0.
tatsuhitos brother is getting involved with said society so tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realm.whats mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship tatsuhito has with his nemesis wang.	0.
wang is a chinese who felt alienated in china so killed his father and developed a crime wing in japan.	0.
wang also is a surprisingly shakespearian character which is weird enough as it is much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with tatsuhito comes to be.	0.
and tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when hes forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother.	0.
while it would be rude to state that miikes movies are successful mostly on their shock value it is true that sometimes its easy to lose track of how well miike can create bitter dis impassioned characters.	0.
the basic story is the story of a cop of japanese cop with chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming chinese mobster.	0.
complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang.	0.
the film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust.	0.
its this complication and loss of way about an hour into the film that makes this less than a great film.it is a very very good one this is definitely worth seeing especially if you dont mind a no frantic pace.a word of warning the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty.	0.
i found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while i tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why.	0.
here we have a chinese taiwanese japanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading english subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties.	0.
plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect.	0.
all in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one.	0.
shinjuku triad society chinese mafia wars is unlikely to get distribution in the west outside film festivals.	0.
could your censors stomach a film where policemen anally rape male and female suspects to get them to talk and the victims enjoy it or see an old lady have her eye torn out of her skull?	0.
these are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent cops and gangsters story.	0.
it makes clockwork orange which was banned for years in the uk look like a disney cartoon.should you see this film?	0.
if you like this make sure you catch dead or alive which is very similar barring the insane ending in doa of course.	0.
the best chance of seeing this film outside a takashi miike retrospective at a film festival is on dvd.	0.
if i havent put you off try hunting for a hong kong version on the web as im sure it will come out in that country.	0.
shinjuku triad society albeit from perfect is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber conventional realm.	0.
its a yakuza triad picture involving cops versus japanese & or chinese gangsters mostly chinese as the title suggests but already even in his first technical debut takashi miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here on in.	0.
social issues like black market trading of precious goods in this case human organs usually from children; nostalgia for childhood and ones roots which was especially prevalent in dead or alive 2; thumbing of the nose at taboos like gay sex and satirical rape violence towards women; blood curdling violence.	0.
its certainly not as surreal as some of miikes most recent films but this is expected as hes trying out things that hes just starting to learn following a track record of straight to video programmers.	0.
its got all of those qualities and its also like the films that would follow from it equally savage and heartfelt crazy in spots and sardonic in its drama and solid for genre fans.the story concerns two brothers one a chinese orphan raised in japan tatsuhito kiriya kippei shiina pretty decent as a eastwood esquire anti hero hero whos become a detective and another whos become a gangster or a would be one.	0.
the main arch likely takeover gang comes from wang a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare time played by tomorowo taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes and his partner karino takeshi caesar whos threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman whos just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a miike movie.	0.
theres some intrigue involving the organ trading scheme with the gangsters which kiriya almost becomes a victim of and the gangs penchant for gay sex  at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want.	0.
it all leads up to vengeance and redemption qualities that miike and his writer are trying to emulate from shakespeare hence the macbeth bit with wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying it wont come off.if it doesnt add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great shakespeare play would have its par for the course of a film like this.	0.
miikes goals are met though just met in his low scale ambitions a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime and what the realm of unrepentant sex with both sexes brings out psychologically in the characters.	0.
at the same time shinjuku triad society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting black comedy from the miike oeuvre.	0.
some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face or the randomness of the interrogation as it goes into a very twisted area.	0.
theres even a laugh out loud line from the young sex slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses thank you mr. weeny burger.	0.
miike and his writer dont have enough here to make the film a full on dark comedy like ichi or of course visitor q but theres enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters.as the first entry of the black society trilogy as its called i was quite impressed and its a fine quasi calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema.	0.
the movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically and these themes are actually apparent in all his films if you look close enough.	0.
shinjuku triad society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders struggling their way to the top of tokyos yakuza.	0.
the kid brother is a lawyer and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one as the movie progresses.	0.
this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over the top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side as seen in the other films of the trilogy.	0.
and as always with miike there are at least two scenes in this that youll never forget see it and figure out which ones for yourself.8 10	0.
a lot has been said about shinjuku triad society as the first true miike film and i thought this sort of description might have been a clich??.	0.
all the miike trademarks are here the violence the black humour the homosexuality the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character.	0.
i think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film.	0.
as you might expect the violence is utterly visceral gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face.	0.
the film has a fantastic pace unlike dead or alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle.	0.
dead or alive also deals with similar issues miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the japanese and chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past.	0.
this is miike before he began to use cgi to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like kitanos sonatine.	0.
the central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished youll be popping it back on again to work it all out.	0.
granted this is not friends at its best but this was the shows pilot lets not forget and not a bad one at that.	0.
even from this first episode we get a sign of the ross rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years when ross says i just want to be married again and rachel storms in with a wedding dress on... probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a monica joey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back.	0.
something else.. in this episode rachel is introduced to chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes the so called flashbacks this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions.	0.
this episode may not be the usual friends as we are accustomed to them with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was!	0.
here it is.. the first ever episode of friends where we get introduced to control freak monica gellar courtney cox newly divorced ross gellar david schimmer hippy pheobe buffay lisa kudrow unknown actor and ladies man matt le blanc and very sarcastic chandler bing matthew perry.	0.
this is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the 6th and final friend spoilt kid rachel green jennifer aniston.the episode is better than most people give credit for like any new sitcom the first episode isnt always fantastic.	0.
the acting in this episode isnt great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters apart from kudrow and perry  who shine.matt le blanc  man his acting was down right dreadful because until later he gets more confident but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails.david schimmer  why does he over pronounce every word?	0.
and i cannot sympathise with him jennifer aniston  looks hot and does a good job as rachel green but we only see the real rachel later in the 1st season courtney cox  looks quite anorexic in this episode its worrying she looks totally different now more healthily she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this 20 minute pilot!	0.
lisa kudrow and matthew perry  im doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb and for lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as pheobe pheebs and matthew perry is just matthew perry playing himself basically!	0.
the episode quality does improve later such as the sets they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly the acting is ok the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot!	0.
it has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season.	0.
extraordinary situations are taking place among six friends who will never leave from our hearts lets say a big thanks to rachel ross monica joey chandler and phoebe!!!	0.
in our first meet we see how rachel dumps a guy in the church how ... understand monicas search for the perfect guy there is no perfect guy why all you women are obsessed with that???	0.
the show gets it rolling from the very first episode a retired jack oneill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion dr. daniel jackson.	0.
through the first two episodes we meet samantha carter a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her and there is tealc a quiet compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team.	0.
the main bad guys are called the gouald they are parasites who can get inserted into ones brain thus controlling them and doing evil deeds.	0.
the warriors behind the gouald are called jaffa who house the parasitic gouald in their bodies until the gouald can get inserted in a persons brain.through the episodes we mostly get to see sg 1 the exploratory team comprised of jack daniel tealc and sam go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets this device is called the stargate and they encounter new cultures or bad guys.	0.
some episodes are on world meaning that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on earth.through the years you start to see a decline in the sg 1 team as close knit and more character building story lines.	0.
this in turn means even more on world episodes which is perfectly understandable.my rating 8.75 10    while most of this show is good there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years.	0.
although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot.	0.
even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice.bravo.a great start to an unbeatable comedy!	0.
in the very first episode of friends which aired 22 sept 1994 the one where monica gets a roommate there is a song playing as rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show the line that plays is if you ever need holding.... does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song?	0.
it just seemed to be believable...thanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years.	0.
in this first episode of friends we are introduced to the 6 main characters of the series monica gellerphoebe buffaychandler bingross geller joey tribbiani and eventually rachel green .we discover that rachel a rich girl that is monicas friend from high school times left her fianc?? barry at the altar since she discovered she didnt love him.	0.
she also decides to live with monica and become independent from her fathergetting a new job as a waitress in central perk.ross for the other handdiscovered his wife is a lesbian and lost her for susan her partner.	0.
we see him moving to a new apartment during the episodemonica in this episode makes out and eventually sleeps with paul the wine guy who gave her the excuse of being impotent since he divorced his wife.	0.
but in reality he was just deceiving her.ps i just loooove joeys and chandlers haircuts in this first season!	0.
it ruined a great episode and so i can only give it a 6. proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film.it was very hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though i dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die.	0.
the more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining.i do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre.	0.
masters of horror right to die starts late one night as married couple abby julia anderson & ciff addison martin donovan are driving home however while talking cliff is distracted & crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road.	0.
cliffs airbag works ok & he walks away with minor injuries unfortunately for abby hers didnt & she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car & doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body.	0.
she is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured & horribly disfigured from the burns.	0.
cliff decides that she should die his selfish lawyer ira corbin bersen thinks they should let abby die sue the car manufacturer & get rich while abbys mum pam linda sorenson wants to blame cliff get rich & save abby.	0.
however abby has other plans of her own...this american canadian co production was directed by rob schmidt whose only horror film previously was wrong turn 2003 which on its own hardly qualifies him to direct a masters of horror episode & was episode 9 from season 2 of the masters of horror tv series while i didnt think right to die was the best masters of horror episode ive seen i thought it was a decent enough effort all the same & still doesnt come close to being as bad as the screwfly solution 2006. the script by john esposito has a neat central idea that isnt anything new but it uses it effectively enough although id say its a bit uneven the first 15 minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for 20 odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over abbys life & the affair cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory & twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart.	0.
the characters are a bit clich??d the weak man the bent lawyer the protective mum & the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough the dialogue is ok the story moves along at a nice pace & overall i liked right to die apart from a few minutes here & there where it loses its focus a bit & i wasnt that keen on the ambiguous ending.director schmidt does a good job & there are some effective scenes this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere & out and out blood & gore.	0.
there are some fantastic special make up effects as usual theres shots of abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body & the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross images & make up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in hellraiser 1987 & its sequels then theres the main course at the end where cliff literally skins someone complete with close ups of scalpels slicing skin open & him peeling it off the muscle & putting it into a cooler box!	0.
theres some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked...technically right to die is excellent the special effects are brilliant & as most masters of horror episodes it doesnt look like a cheap made for tv show which basically if the truth be told it is.	0.
the acting was fine but theres no big names in this one.right to die is another enjoyable & somewhat twisted masters of horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene!	0.
what starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining.	0.
right to die is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore.spoilers here top credits also go to the dead on performance from martin donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen.	0.
playing the character in a great aloof fashion you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails.	0.
corbin bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not so good guy who gets his just desserts.end of spoiler.as a revenge from the dead flick right to die benefits heavily from its performers and is more than an ok way to spend less than an hour.	0.
this is one of the best episode from the second season of moh i think mick garris has a problem with women... he killem all they are often the victims screwfly solution pro life valerie on the stairs i dont remember the argentos episode in season 1 etc.	0.
never least right to die is one of the best with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense specially with the photos from the cell scene wonderful.	0.
the acting is like the entire series regular i could be worst like pro life or we scream for ice cream.	0.
the ideology of the series is horrible killing and terminating women mutilating animals and on and on... the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like cigarrette burns the best of all homecoming the most funny imprint really shocking.	0.
im not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a master in the genre of horror since he previously just directed one horror film called wrong turn and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre but fact is that he made with right to die one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the masters of horror franchise.	0.
there was a similar underdog story in season one when william malone made on of the best episodes with the fair haired child even though his other long feature films fear dot com and house on haunted hill sucked pretty badly.the story of right to die cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia but thankfully also features multiple old fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance murderous conspiracies pitch black humor and comic book styled violence.	0.
whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husbands continuous adultery the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident.	0.
cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially.	0.
whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney corbin bernsen of the dentist want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor abbeys mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff.	0.
meanwhile abbeys hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliffs surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices.	0.
after a few victims cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well.	0.
right to die is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tv series concept like masters of horror.	0.
the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons.	0.
actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks which is always a welcome plus and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean spirited and egocentric bastard.	0.
i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this seasons entries.	0.
while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries at least this episode turned out well.	0.
its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season.	0.
while they speak they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire.	0.
once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes.	0.
hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever.	0.
from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it right to die should have the right to go on living forever.	0.
when the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live.	0.
the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him.this comes to us from director rob schmidt who made wrong turn a film i have not seen.	0.
with only one horror film under his belt and not a particularly notorious one at that i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode expecting schmidt to be a master of horror in only the most liberal sense.	0.
as of episode 10 in a 13 episode season this was actually the best one yet.the issue of the right to die is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device.	0.
i read a review of this episode prior to watching it where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of hellraiser in this.	0.
then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of hellraiser 2. however i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film.	0.
i can see no other way to create the effect that was created and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than hellraiser 2.some plot twists show up later on and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look.	0.
i didnt watch it a second time but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had not that its confusing.	0.
the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him.	0.
i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist but hes completely unlovable.while the stuart gordon episode may be better and im excited about the washingtonians episode i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine.	0.
when legends like john carpenter let me down again i get a bit worried about the genres future but then a fresh face like rob schmidt comes along and gives me hope.	0.
in the stargate universe humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the goauld such as ra and apophis.	0.
as a result earth cultures such as those of the aztecs mayans britons the norse mongols greeks and romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy.	0.
many well known mythical locations such as avalon camelot and atlantis are found or have at one time existed.presently the earth stargate found at a dig site near giza in 1928 is housed in a top secret u.s. military base known as the sgc stargate command underneath cheyenne mountain.	0.
samantha carter tapping and tealc judge compose the original sg 1 team a few characters join and or leave the team in later seasons.	0.
along with 24 other sg teams they venture to distant planets exploring the galaxy and searching for defenses from the goauld in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races.the parasitic goauld use advanced technology to cast themselves as egyptian gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship.	0.
they are a race of highly intelligent ruthless snake like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species including humans.	0.
the ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship.	0.
the introduction of the ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on egyptian mythology into an exploration of the arthurian mythology surrounding the ori their followers and their enemies??the ancients.	0.
those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic ec comics were based on will recognize this one right off the bat.underrated indie favorite martin donovan also an excellent writer   co author of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way.	0.
he could play a really nice if misunderstood guy next door or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness.	0.
in the case of right to die he takes the latter approach and it definitely works.donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist robin sydney much to the displeasure of his inconsolable unforgiving spouse abbey julia anderson.	0.
when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of making up and shes horribly burned in a fire hes reluctant to pull the plug on her not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy corbin bernsen looking the worse for wear these days.	0.
but abbeys never been one to give up without a fight and thats where the ec theme of the episode comes in.	0.
cuckolded husbands   and wives   have always been the genres favorite subject matter for some spooky and ooky supernatural shenanigans and this case is definitely no exception.	0.
if anything the ramped up quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere.and thats not to mention that john espositos original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist.	0.
you dont realize as youre watching that you only know half the story until close to the end...think what lies beneath with more guts and gazongas and youre there.not a bad effort but not the best of the lot either.	0.
at least rob schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed!	0.
as with most moh episodes this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment so the extremely squeamish need not apply.	0.
i was all ready to pan this episode seeing that this master really doesnt have any horror films under his belt.. but this is easily the best episode of the season.the acting was good!!	0.
and while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 mins something that has been lacking up to this point in the series.i especially liked the bit at the end not a twist per say but just a funny little bit where he becomes as ever the hen pecked hubby.really good effort.	0.
like ive said in other reviews  these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes.. but they may someday end up being masters in the future.	0.
maybe its just because i have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff but this one got under my skin pardon the pun.	0.
this piece is brave not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies.	0.
not only did i find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the screwee i felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself.	0.
its a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider but i enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile.	0.
down right horror for a change with a story that is way way above the average moh episodes if there is such a thing.	0.
she is burned beyond recognition great makeup btw and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft.	0.
but even in a coma she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology and when she does die for a few minutes her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit.	0.
well not much because this baby has it all and a very satirical ending that should leave a smile on most viewers faces.	0.
but the fun is in the journey.i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times.yes its predictable and yes its a clich?? romantic comedy.	0.
but the point is that its a sweet story the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways.the dialog is dead on and the acting is well done on all parts and over the top for comic effect.	0.
for those that panned it for being predictable   if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing... then you want a thriller.	0.
this is a romantic comedy... it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life and it has been worth every effort along the way.great date movie great movie for a happy cry...	0.
fi you want to watch a movie that doesnt demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it.	0.
its just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings.	0.
late in the third act i was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together.	0.
does anyone know the exact quote about time and love by george ede aka father fitzpatrick in the move it had to be you?	0.
i met my one true love my soulmate and although i had the experience to meet him when i had least expecting it i wasnt ready for that kind of emotional relationship.	0.
he finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry & in disbelief about the way it turned out.	0.
i had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 years.this movie meant a lot because i am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love.	0.
i can now appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of father fitzpatrick rang true for me.i know when he has healed enough to trust me again we will remarry.dont ever get complacent and take true love for granted!	0.
id have given this film a few stars simply because it was a lifetime presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story   here new york city.	0.
are filmed in vancouver ottawa toronto or some other canadian locale.but if there ever were one deserving the top rating   10* on this site its this movie.	0.
certainly not for originality for this story has been done many times in many variations with several very similar to this specific one.	0.
its also been done pretty often on the big screen with mega stars past and present from cary grant james garner harrison ford tom hanks et al   and deborah kerr doris day meg ryan and many more.	0.
i can think of at least 10 12 more just as prominent past to present off the top of my head who could be added now and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind.not to drone on but my point is that in my opinion this is by far one of the best of this genre ive seen.	0.
i caught it by chance on a mid day friday at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week.	0.
the only two actors i knew were phyllis newman annas mother whom id seen in some things from her younger days and michael rispoli henry charlies best friend who was outstanding as gramma the menacing juice loan tough street guy from rounders.	0.
the chance meeting and coupling between both leads best friends as a sub story romance with the correlation of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later is an oft done plot contrivance within the genre but makes no difference to the enjoyment here in fact it enhances it.checking some other comments i agree completely with those which are the most positive.	0.
this adjective describes the performers; the characters; the chemistry between and among all of the characters in whatever combination presented and all of the supporting and even minor roles.i love films with a harder edge rounders; the escapist schwarzenegger stallone fare; goodfellows; even the classics like casablanca gone with the wind citizen kane.	0.
with a bare fraction of their budgets it was equal to the results achieved by youve got mail and sleepless in seattle.	0.
and tom hanks and meg ryan couldnt have done better than natasha henstridge and michael vartan here; the co stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega films as well.	0.
the ex cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting even though they are marrying other people.	0.
maybe a little trite in that the partners are both type a personalities while our protagonists are much more relaxed.	0.
and hey for the guys   sell the natasha henstridge angle and the gals   sell them the sappy romance everyone wins!	0.
its amazing that from a good though not wonderful film made back in the early nineties a whole franchise can grow.	0.
stargate; sg1 is without a doubt a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder to shoulder with star trek as the kings of sci fi.following on from the 1994 feature film stargate this series sees stargate command a military science organisation figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore.	0.
sg1 is one such team headed by military veteran colonel jack oneill and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson military scientist captain samantha carter and alien tealc who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people.	0.
earth quickly makes an enemy of the goauld a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods.the top notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life.	0.
richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic oneill who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye.	0.
michael shanks as daniel brings heart and an will of steel to the character who has grown from wide eyed innocence to darker and more hard bitten as the show has progressed.	0.
amanda tapping as carter has perfected the balance between depicting her characters femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong intelligent military scientist.	0.
christopher judge is excellent as the aloof tealc who is able to depict the characters emotions with subtlety.	0.
and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness.almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs often shown through arguments between oneill and jackson.	0.
guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that doesnt bore viewers.	0.
sure this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clich??s but its entertaining and thats what i watch movies for.	0.
i guess we see what we want to see.olivia dabo and michael rigoli were fun to watch even if dabos british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech.	0.
to tell you the truth i hadnt really noticed it until i read these comments but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me but she was ideal for her role with that one exception.	0.
its a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others but who find their soul mates in one another.	0.
thats why we watch them to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen.	0.
dont get me wrong though it has to be a sentimental scene and this movie had plenty of those.i give it 9 10 only because im saving my 10 10 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day.	0.
if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies or whatever make a note to watch it.	0.
the thing i enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear.	0.
my wife and i commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something.	0.
if you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you.	0.
finally found it yesterday 2 13 02 on lifetime movie channel.jim larsons comments about it being a sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths were dead on.	0.
writers probably shouldnt get a bonus everyone else sro for making the movie.anybody who appreciates a romantic movie should see it.natashas screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric to say nothing of her beauty that anything she is in goes on my favorite list.	0.
her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for.god bless her her family and future endeavors.this movie doesnt seem to available in dvd or video yet but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too.	0.
this is the first michael vartan movie ive seen i havent seen alias  and i was curious to see if the guy can act.he sure can and is likable in this movie.natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action rolesso i found her very good and lovable in this differentsweet role of a schoolteacher.	0.
some of the negative comments i read are truethe movie is full of clich??s and the story doesnt ring true at all.alsoeven though every character in the movie remarks how good they look togetheri dont think there is screen chemistry there.	0.
howeveri enjoyed this movie.the locales are nicethe characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good.	0.
if you are expecting to see a great romancethis is not it.but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good.	0.
yes it is a typical boy meets girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by.	0.
and vartan holds his own.there is simmering chemistry between the two leads; the film is most alive when they share a scene   lots!	0.
it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together...ignore the negative comments   if you are feeling a bit blue watch this flick you will feel so much better.	0.
if you are already happy then you will be euphoric.ps i am 33 male from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess...	0.
this great movie has failed to register a higher rating than 5!why not!it is a great portrayal of the life of christ without the ruthless sensationalism of the passion of the christ.johnny cash did great things for god which amazingly are shunned and neglected in areas where they should matter mostlike our churches.the film itself took less than a month to film as johnny felt the strong presence of god guiding him through it.great credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fans.at least the billy graham crusade rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new christians.thanks fox for producing it.as walk the line proved that it was freakish that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpiece.movies are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves!	0.
in summary i believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright honestly portrayed and a great witness to the christian faith!	0.
this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash adorned in black of course who sings a lot and narrates a bit also.	0.
also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this work...just for fun try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair...?	0.
johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories.	0.
the music is great you get a real feel of what the world of jesus looked like ive been there too and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with a passion.	0.
3. because it is uncompelling i doubt well see this ever widely distributed again.id love to buy the cd.tom paine texas usa	0.
my favorite parts were the fact that 1 jesus was blond 2 the last supper was a huge meal3  he liked playing with the children4 his death was for all people and for all time.the movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting but it touched my heart at that time.	0.
i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack oneill.	0.
the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner season after season.	0.
the jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between.	0.
the plot was enough to tie it all together a woman eva dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was to be husband its sounds far fetched but it actually works quite well.	0.
proves eva longoria parker is head and shoulders in rom com above bad actors such as kate hudson and jennifer aniston who mug and call it acting.	0.
whoda thunk it?parker and isla fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as over her dead body.	0.
and finally paul rudd gets to shine in a really good movie instead of lesser films.a movie like this never gets its dues from close minded males.	0.
as other imdb reviewers here have noted there is nothing lame about this gem   no hack writing or acting.	0.
and its depiction of contemporary l.a. and california in general makes every scene look bright beautiful clean and otherwise outstanding in every way.	0.
ah what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie.i wont divulge the plot but as a long time and hard core atheist i was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light hearted piece of entertainment.	0.
it reminds me very much of the old topper movies which were also so enjoyable.this movie exposes popular but otherwise hackneyed movies like ghost for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are.	0.
some of us save our praise for the truly worthy however.if you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as into the night with michelle pfeiffer jeff goldblum and clu gulager blind date with bruce willis and kim basinger american dreamer with jobeth williams chances are with robert downey jr. christopher mcdonald and cybil sheppard making mr. right with john malkovich etc.	0.
a first rate job all around even if its kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years.	0.
although eva longoria parkers character reminded very much of gabrielle from desperate housewives but so what?	0.
this had a good story...it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool.ive watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one ive seen in the two weeks.jason biggs character was the best though.even though it was small it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning.this may be a romantic comedy and i dont like most but the writing direction performing sound design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool.this film scored pretty high out of all the movies ive seen lately   and the rest were big budget or better publicized.good job in writing.	0.
the humour is consistently dry and witty.paul rudd pretty much plays the mike character from friends which works great.	0.
the other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic i mean we are not talking apocalypse now here but the characters are likable the story is engaging the soundtrack production and direction all work well.in all a great feel good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets.everyone has their own tastes but i really dont understand the one star reviews for this.	0.
actually my vote is a 7.5. anyway the movie was good it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it dont misunderstand me is not the funniest movie of the world and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies but this one has its own taste a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends... i think that not exactly but who cares?	0.
also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic chris rock appears in it the name is down to earth men that one its a very funny movie see both if you want and i know that you will agree that mr. rock won with his movie.	0.
i would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ashton kutcher however the film is good.	0.
i watched this on an 8 hour flight and presumably because of the pressure and the altitude i actually found it mildly entertaining emphasis on the mild.the actual idea behind the film was brilliant a woman dies her fianc?? falls in love with someone else she decided to make sure they dont get together but eventually she lets them do it.	0.
the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest it wasnt really very funny.in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me but it was a close call.	0.
i wasnt a fan of seeing this movie at all but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics.overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much.	0.
but it was enough to tell the whole story build some character development and have a decent happy ending.	0.
eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast especially jason biggs kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace.overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating.	0.
hey its a chick flick and im reviewing this movie from a guys persepctive alright it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it.	0.
however if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie then youve come to the right place.	0.
over her dead body was a nice little movie.it was decent and entertaining while still being pretty funny.there were a few clich??s but i found most stuff fresh.at first i didnt think it was going to be good at allwhen it started out.if you can get past the first 20 minutes thoughthe movie starts getting more interesting.this film wasnt burst out in laughter hilariousand wasnt oh my gosh wonderful.it was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was.i dont see how this movie was bad.its rating is just a bit too low.i couldve dealt with a 5.5but a 4.8?alsogiving this movie a 1 is disgraceful.it was pretty goodand there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a 1which is what most people gave it.	0.
i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 vote if claudia black had not continued on in it!	0.
to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a mistake.unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of jack and really didnt need this great series turned into new episodes of farscape.i was a great fan of the film stargate and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked.	0.
i reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clich??s obvious jokes and overacting all of which the trailer had promised.however after 5 minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting.	0.
with only one toilet humour gag over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and without spoiling anything too much some of the moments involving animals are hilarious.the staple ingredients of a good film are all there; script director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy this film stands tall.sure you arent going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time!	0.
once when i was in college and we had an international fair the russian section had a soviet era poster saying ne boltay!	0.
in this case the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the axis powers have attacked the united states.	0.
as in the russians are coming the russians are coming the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time so that when it gets back to snafu...well you know what i mean!	0.
yes its mostly wwii propaganda   complete with a derogatory term for the japanese   but i have to say that the pvt.	0.
of course since they had dr. seuss writing and mel blanc providing the voices its no surprise that these came out rather cool.	0.
friz frelengs rumours is an excellent private snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic inducing rumours during wartime.	0.
produced as were all the snafu shorts to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films rumours is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan.	0.
when snafu starts a rumour about a bombing it escalates into an eventual rumour that america has lost the war.	0.
this is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long rubbery piece of baloney and several strange fictional creatures who come back to haunt snafu with ever more terrible news about his countrys military.	0.
rumours is inventive fast paced and funny all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured dont badmouth the military message.	0.
the films were aimed at servicemen and were directed animated and scored by some of the top talent from warner bros. termite terrace including friz freleng chuck jones and carl stalling.	0.
the invaluable mel blanc supplied the voice for snafu and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by theodor geisel i.e.	0.
the idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery using the character of snafu as a perfect negative example he was the dope the little twerp who would do everything youre not supposed to do.	0.
according to chuck jones the scripts had to be approved by pentagon officials but army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow   all for the greater good of course.as the title would indicate this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors.	0.
private snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine something you wont see in any other hollywood films of the era and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling.	0.
we observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted then exaggerated then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp.	0.
the imagery is indeed vivid the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air i.e balloon juice.	0.
a soldier shoots his mouth off cannon style and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction.	0.
panicked soldiers tell each other that the brooklyn bridge has been pulverized coney island wiped out enemy troops have landed on the white house lawn and the japanese are in california.	0.
the visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for rumor itis and private snafu has been locked up in a padded cell.this is a highly effective piece of work.	0.
the filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy and the message is still a valid one.	0.
in recent years weve seen that catastrophic events real or imagined can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances.	0.
because the technology has improved the private snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e mail cellphones and blogging.	0.
consequently rumors is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesnt feel at all dated; in fact it may be more timely than ever.	0.
this was another world war ii message to the soldiers and to the allies to be careful about spreading rumors.	0.
these were called instructional cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny looking main character called pvt.	0.
snafu.all of us have imaginations along with fears and what have you and thats what happens here as pvt.	0.
you can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them.	0.
as i write this there were two terrorist bombings in europe today and some people still think the war on terror is just a bumper sticker slogan.	0.
amazing.the writer the famous dr. suess uses analogies of hot air balloon juice here to present the above message.	0.
with theodore geisel his real name you know the rhymes will be clever.nothing hilarious here but it wasnt meant to be.	0.
you have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was out there during world war ii.	0.
though structured totally different from the book by tim krabb?? who wrote the original the vanishing spoorloos it does have the same overall feel except for that koolhovens style is less business like and more lyric.	0.
as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very beautifully.	0.
where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject de grot stays always within the boundaries of good taste.	0.
tim krabbe is the praised author of het gouden ei a novel that was put on the screen twice spoorloos and the vanishing.	0.
one of the dutch writers more recent works is de grot a psychological thriller about two totally different men egon and axel who meet at a youth camp and surprising enough become friends for dear life.	0.
axel on the other hand is a charismatic party animal a heavy drinking criminal whose everydays concern is to get a woman into his bedroom.	0.
from the moment they meet axel has a strong influence on egon while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything such as reading thick books like egon; ultimately egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country.after having read the book last year i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it.	0.
while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people the plot becomes more of a puzzle the many episodes are not presented chronologically so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode.	0.
because of this the story feels surprisingly remote you often need to know a characters background to really care for him or her.	0.
in real life such one dimensional people rarely exist; in books and films they always seem to be there taking away a lot of credibility.despite all this the film was a pleasant surprise being much better than the book.	0.
the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography humour and acting fedja van huet egon is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting which is in my opinion the highest an actor can achieve.	0.
the drawbacks of the film however are the same as the books mainly because the characters are one dimensional they are so predictable that it becomes annoying.	0.
it is obvious that this talented director thats what the movie makes clear anyway is hampered by a deficient screenplay.	0.
another of his books het gouden ei was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called spoorloos the vanishing in 1988. this one is not as good as that thriller although much better than the american remake also called the vanishing but there are times it comes close.especially the opening moments are terrific.	0.
later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman both stating that they have never done anything like this.from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash forward.	0.
we see how egon still as a child here played by erik van der horst befriends a guy named axel as a kid played by benja bruijning.	0.
we learn how they grew up as friends sort of and how axel as an adult played by marcel hensema became a criminal.	0.
around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with him.the movie is chronological in a way.	0.
but from time to time like i said the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again.	0.
every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults.minor spoilers herein.the title means the cave and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending although it is in fact not that happy.	0.
the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes only to come back at that point in the end.	0.
it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well.	0.
though structured totally different from the book by tim krabb?? who wrote the original the vanishing spoorloos it does have the same overall feel except for that koolhovens style is less business like and more lyric.	0.
as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very beautifully.	0.
where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject de grot stays always within the boundaries of good taste.	0.
some really top class acting not only by van hu??t but especially by marcel hensema who mostly did tv work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf.	0.
then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash back structure which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character driven drama of the movie.	0.
i started watching the show from the first season and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it.	0.
original movie was kind of childish and i was just looking for some sci fi show while waiting for the bsg new season.but after few episodes i became a fan.	0.
ive loved the characters   the not so stupid as you think he is jack oneill the not only smart samantha carter the glorious tealc women and kids favorite and brilliant dr. daniel jackson.of course stories sometimes not serious sometimes even ridiculous but mostly its not about technology or space fighting   its about helping your friend even risking your life for him.	0.
about the free will and all good qualities that makes a human   human.and now its breaking a record going 10th season and still doing good.	0.
indian directors have it tough they have to compete with movies like laggan where 11 henpeckedcastrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots.	0.
devdas a hapless fedar  festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any ones feelings or sentiments alas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry.	0.
but to make a good movie you have to tight rope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with split skirts and dishum dishum fights preferably involving a nitwit bollywood leading actor who is marginally handsome.	0.
so you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of leonine village head who in own words defending his village this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience.	0.
nana patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him meanwhile his daughter is bathing his grandson.this is as authentic a scene you can get in rural india.	0.
nana patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in hindi films.	0.
the violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with song&dances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies wont sell a sad but true state of affairs.	0.
another film starring aishu and shah rukh little did i know that aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with srk and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just 15 minutes.	0.
its a film about transformations ignorance coming of age stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life.	0.
its actually a dream sequence that occurs while srks drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze.	0.
he dreams that aishwarya rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day dressed scantily and begins to seduce him.	0.
but the main point again as his movies tend to be the man is the best actor in idia and can turn dust into gold.	0.
one man that will never ever disappoint you.good movie although i think shahrukh was a luxury this movie could have done without.	0.
but this man is really something elase.the movie is cool the music and direction is excellent plot a bit thin but the screen play and dialog again very good.	0.
the story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag especially when shahrukh comes in the picture.	0.
what really made me like it were the performances of the leads the dialog delivery as well as the story for what it was.	0.
the supporting case was even great including karimas mother in law even though she just had one shining moment it was great to watch her.the sets were also pretty good.	0.
i didnt really like their portrayal of a canadian family but once they step in india its as real as it gets.overall i would give it a thumbs up!	0.
a strong woman oriented subject after long director krishna vamsis shakti  the power the desi version of the hollywood hit not without my daughter is actress sridevis first home production.	0.
a story about a womans fight against harsh injustice.the story of the film revolves around nandini karisma kapoor who lives in canada with her two uncles tiku talsania jaspal bhatti.	0.
but their happiness is short lived as the news of shekhars ailing mother deepti navalmakes them leave their perfect life in canada and come to india.	0.
from the moment they reachindia both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere.	0.
they take a crowded train to reach shekhars village and when they finally reach the station they have to catch a long bus drive to his village.	0.
and unfortunately for them a frenzied mob that beat shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus.	0.
after that they drive to the handing havel where shekhars father narsimha nana patekar lives with his wife deepti naval.	0.
nandani realized that her father in law is in command as soon as she enters the place but her only solace is her mother in laws warm welcome.living there nandini learns of her father in laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him.	0.
the day she sees her father in law teach her son to throw a bomb she loses it and lashes out against him insisting to shekhar that they move back to canada.	0.
but terror strikes again when shekhar is murdered one day leaving a broken down nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel father in law.	0.
her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart wrenching film.what sets apart shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie.	0.
another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast.	0.
sanjay kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors.	0.
shahrukhs cameo provides the lighter moments and surely hes been pulled in to get the required star value.	0.
overall shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the pr release hype is sure to get it a good opening.	0.
however i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied.	0.
it has characteristics of a romantic comedy a political commentary a thriller a drama an action movie a musical and an absurdist self conscious art film.	0.
its all in there adding up to a myth.the basic premise is about an indian couple nandini karishma kapoor and shekhar sanjay kapoor happily living in canada who rush to india to visit the husbands parents after a disturbing news report.	0.
the rest of the story takes place in india where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence.	0.
at one point the story borrows from not without my baby but to call shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice.the ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions including shah rukh khans dream of aishwarya rai which comes as if out of another movie.	0.
in fact the two stars are on all the posters but they appear really late in the film and only shah rukh ends up being a real character.	0.
yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance.karishma kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film and she does an admirable job having to link up the films twists and turns with a show of believable emotion.	0.
another notable presence is nana patekar who plays narsimha the tyrannical father of the husband shekhar.	0.
nana patekar dominates every scene hes in with a scary but nuanced character.the movie is not without its share of realism.	0.
violence is rampant but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters with karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions.	0.
at times this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic.i have seen a share of bollywood releases and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm.	0.
it is a film that achieves the grandeur of a shakespearian tragedy where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained.	0.
it is pure gratuitous cinema and the director krishna vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book.	0.
perhaps the all important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind but i came out of watching shakti exhilarated.	0.
the interaction between nandini and her father in law   the power of their dysfunctional relationship   and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie.	0.
shah rukh khans performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor.	0.
it is easy to get caught up in the love violence and redemption of lives in this film and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax.	0.
